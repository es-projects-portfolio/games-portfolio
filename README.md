# Games Portfolio

This repository represents my progress of part of work from July 2022 - March 2024 (1 year 9 months).
Started my career as Game Developer was a hard journey. I only published in this repo as part of my learning.

## `backend-games`
There are 3 directories:
- `metx-autosigner` : i helped assist my senior for this project. mainly we made it from scratch. it use to share other game devs who wants to join the platform to integrate their game with our blockchain
- `metx-games-database-service` : this directory is mainly for our games to store points, tokens, and more.
- `metx-games-socket-service` : this directory is for the games which wants to include multilayer service to connected to websocket

## `html5-games`
In the beginning of my career, i enjoyed learning javascript. I started to create many games using vanilla javascript and react.
I only publish 3 games from other games i have created to this repo.
- [`html5-2048`]('https://github.com/es-projects-portfolio/games-portfolio/tree/main/html5-games/html5-2048') : using only with database service
- [`html-hextris`]('https://github.com/es-projects-portfolio/games-portfolio/tree/main/html5-games/html5-hextris') : using only with database service
- [`react-tictactoe-multiplayer`]('https://github.com/es-projects-portfolio/games-react-tictactoe-multiplayer') : integrate the websocket service

## `unity-games`
Apart of my work I have done, i chose 3 games only to be shared in this repo. All the games were integrated with `metx-games-database-service` and `metx-autosigner`.
Most of the games were created from scratch and some are open source. The models were mostly taken from unity asset store.
