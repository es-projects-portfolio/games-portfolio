Welcome to my Games Portfolio repository, showcasing my journey and progress as a Game Developer from July 2022 to March 2024. 
This collection represents a culmination of my learning, collaboration, and dedication to the craft of game development.

## `backend-games`
This directory comprises essential backend components crucial for seamless integration with blockchain technology and multiplayer functionalities.
There are 3 directories:
- `metx-autosigner`
  - This project, developed in collaboration with a senior colleague, serves as a foundational piece for onboarding game developers onto our platform. It facilitates the integration of their games with our blockchain infrastructure, ensuring security and integrity throughout the process.
- `metx-games-database-service`
  - Our robust database service enables efficient storage and management of crucial in-game elements such as points, tokens, and user data. This ensures a smooth gaming experience while maintaining data integrity and security.
- `metx-games-socket-service`
  - For games requiring real-time multiplayer interactions, our socket service provides a seamless connection via websockets. This facilitates synchronous gameplay experiences, enhancing engagement and excitement for players.

## `unity-games`
In this section, I present a selection of Unity games demonstrating my versatility in game development. All the games were integrated with `metx-games-database-service` and `metx-autosigner`.
Most of the games were created from scratch and some are open source. The models were mostly taken from unity asset store.
